# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and semantic versioning.

A consuming project pins this plugin by `ref` or `sha`, so a change to anything under `hooks/`,
`skills/`, `agents/`, `templates/`, or to `AUTONOMY-CHARTER.md`, is a change to their sessions.

- **Major** — a consumer must edit their own `.claude/efficiency.md` or settings to keep working
- **Minor** — a new skill, a new agent, a new policy key with a safe default
- **Patch** — corrections, clarifications, price-table refreshes

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-05

First release. Deliberately not 1.0.0: the mechanism is measured and self-tested, but three things
in the plan's verification list have not happened yet, and calling it 1.0.0 would claim they had.

### Added

- **The autopilot `Stop` hook** (`hooks/autopilot-stop.py`) — refuses to end a turn while an
  approved run has open tasks and the gate is green. Inert unless `.claude/efficiency.local.md`
  exists, which is Claude Code's documented conditional-activation pattern and removes the need for
  a switch anyone could forget.
- **Four nested guards**: a per-task spend ceiling measured from the session transcript, a gate
  retry budget, a run-wide continuation budget, and the platform's own anti-stall cap. An
  unmeasurable ceiling fails closed and stops the run.
- **The spend meter** (`hooks/lib/spend.py`) — weighted token cost per model from the transcript,
  including subagent transcripts, with a dated price table (`hooks/lib/model-costs.json`).
- **The autonomy charter** (`AUTONOMY-CHARTER.md`), carried into adopting projects by a
  `SessionStart` hook and versioned with the plugin rather than copied into each project.
- **Three agents with pinned models**: `implementer-fast` (haiku), `architect` (opus, read-only),
  `reviewer` (opus, read-only).
- **Five skills**: `init`, `plan-run`, `run`, `fanout`, `run-report`.
- **The policy scaffolding** a project owns: `templates/efficiency.md` and
  `templates/settings.permissions.json`.
- **`docs/verified-platform-behaviour.md`** — every platform fact the design rests on, measured with
  its method and date, re-runnable via `scripts/probes/stop-cap.sh`.
- **`scripts/qa.sh`** — this repo's gate, which reports what it could not run rather than passing
  silently.

### Measured, not assumed

- The `Stop` block cap counts consecutive blocks **without progress**; any tool call resets it, a
  read-only one included. The cap is an anti-stall guard, not a ceiling on autonomy.
- `transcript_path` is present in the `Stop` payload although the hook reference does not list it
  for that event.
- Subagent turns are **not** in the main transcript despite `isSidechain` existing in its schema.
  They were 17% of spend on the session that built this, and the expensive half by design.
- A freshly created directory is untrusted, and its project settings are ignored in silence — the
  failure most easily misread as a platform change.

### Verified end to end

- **The plugin loads and its components are addressable.** `claude --plugin-dir .` exposes all eight
  as `efficiency:*` — three agents and five skills — which is also why the skills refer to agents by
  their namespaced names rather than their bare ones.
- **Adoption works, but not the way it first looked.** A `--scope project` install writes only
  `enabledPlugins` into the project; the marketplace stays in user settings, and committing
  `extraKnownMarketplaces` into a project does not register it. That split is right — trusting a
  marketplace is the machine owner's decision, not a cloned repo's — and the README now documents
  the measured path rather than the assumed one.
- **The autopilot blocks in a real session.** A throwaway project with two open tasks, a green gate
  and `continuations_max: 2`: the hook blocked twice, incremented the counter itself, then stopped
  the run with a reason naming both open tasks. The guard is real, not a diagram.

### Not yet verified

- Coexistence with a second `Stop` hook registered by a consuming project, and what that does to the
  shared `stop_hook_active` flag and the eight available blocks.
- The measurement that actually matters: a real run of ten tasks with every interruption counted and
  classified against the six causes. That number is the metric this framework is judged on, and
  until it exists the framework is a hypothesis with tests.
